# Weight Converter (Kilo ↔ Pound)

## 📋 Description
A simple Java console app that converts between **kilograms** and **pounds**.

It asks the user:
- Which conversion they want (`K-P` for kilos to pounds, `P-K` for pounds to kilos).
- How much they want to convert.
- Then shows the result!

> **Note:** Use a **comma** (`,`) for decimal numbers (example: `10,5`).

- Error handling is included if you type something wrong.
- You can expand this project later with other conversions (like grams ↔ ounces, etc).
